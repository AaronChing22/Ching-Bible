					<p>
						<b>1:1</b> In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. <br/>
						<b>1:2</b> And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. <br/>
						<b>1:3</b> And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.<br/>
						<b>1:4</b> And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.<br/>
						<b>1:5</b> And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.<br/>
						<b>1:6</b> And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.<br/>
						<b>1:7</b> And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.<br/>
						<b>1:8</b> And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.<br/>
						<b>1:9</b> And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.<br/>
						<b>1:10</b> And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.<br/>
						<b>1:11</b> And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.<br/>
						<b>1:12</b> And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.<br/>
						<b>1:13</b> And the evening and the morning were the third day.<br/>
						<b>1:14</b> And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:<br/>
						<b>1:15</b> And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.<br/>
						<b>1:16</b> And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.<br/>
						<b>1:17</b> And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,<br/>
						<b>1:18</b> And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.<br/>
						<b>1:19</b> And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.<br/>
						<b>1:20</b> And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.<br/>
						<b>1:21</b> And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.<br/>
						<b>1:22</b> And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.<br/>
						<b>1:23</b> And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.<br/>
						<b>1:24</b> And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.<br/>
						<b>1:25</b> And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.<br/>
						<b>1:26</b> And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.<br/>
						<b>1:27</b> So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.<br/>
						<b>1:28</b> And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.<br/>
						<b>1:29</b> And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.<br/>
						<b>1:30</b> And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.<br/>
						<b>1:31</b> And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.<br/>

						<b>1:3</b> Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,<br/>
						<b>1:4</b> Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.<br/>
						<b>1:5</b> And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.<br/>
						<b>1:6</b> And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.<br/>
						<b>1:7</b> And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.<br/>
						<b>1:8</b> Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.<br/>
						<b>1:9</b> And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:<br/>
						<b>1:10</b> Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.<br/>
						<b>1:11</b> Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.<br/>
						<b>1:12</b> But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.<br/>
						<b>1:13</b> And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:<br/>
						<b>1:14</b> And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.<br/>
						<b>1:15</b> And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:<br/>
						<b>1:16</b> And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.<br/>
						<b>1:17</b> But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.<br/>
						<b>1:18</b> And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?<br/>
						<b>1:19</b> And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.<br/>
						<b>1:20</b> Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.<br/>
						<b>1:21</b> And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.<br/>
						<b>1:21</b> And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.<br/>

						<b>1:2</b> (There are eleven days'' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)<br/>
						<b>1:3</b> And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them;<br/>
						<b>1:4</b> After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:<br/>
						<b>1:5</b> On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,<br/>
						<b>1:6</b> The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:<br/>
						<b>1:7</b> Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.<br/>
						<b>1:8</b> Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.<br/>
						<b>1:9</b> And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:<br/>
						<b>1:10</b> The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.<br/>
						<b>1:11</b> (The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)<br/>
						<b>1:12</b> How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?<br/>
						<b>1:13</b> Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.<br/>
						<b>1:14</b> And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.<br/>
						<b>1:15</b> So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.<br/>
						<b>1:16</b> And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.<br/>
						<b>1:17</b> Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God''s: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.<br/>
						<b>1:18</b> And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.<br/>
						<b>1:19</b> And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.<br/>
						<b>1:20</b> And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.<br/>
						<b>1:21</b> Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.<br/>
						<b>1:22</b> And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.<br/>
						<b>1:23</b> And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:<br/>
						<b>1:24</b> And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.<br/>
						<b>1:25</b> And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.<br/>
						<b>1:26</b> Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:<br/>
						<b>1:27</b> And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.<br/>
						<b>1:28</b> Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.<br/>
						<b>1:29</b> Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.<br/>
						<b>1:30</b> The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;<br/>
						<b>1:31</b> And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.<br/>

						<b>1:33</b> Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.<br/>
						<b>1:34</b> And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,<br/>
						<b>1:35</b> Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers,<br/>
						<b>1:36</b> Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.<br/>
						<b>1:37</b> Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.<br/>
						<b>1:38</b> But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.<br/>
						<b>1:39</b> Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.<br/>
						<b>1:40</b> But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.<br/>
						<b>1:41</b> Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.<br/>
						<b>1:42</b> And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.<br/>
						<b>1:43</b> So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.<br/>
						<b>1:44</b> And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah.<br/>
						<b>1:45</b> And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.<br/>

					<p>
						<b>1:1</b> Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?<br/>
						<b>1:2</b> And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.<br/>
						<b>1:3</b> And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.<br/>
						<b>1:4</b> And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.<br/>
						<b>1:5</b> And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.<br/>
						<b>1:6</b> But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.<br/>
						<b>1:7</b> And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.<br/>
						<b>1:8</b> Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.<br/>
						<b>1:9</b> And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.<br/>
						<b>1:10</b> And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.<br/>
						<b>1:11</b> And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher:<br/>
						<b>1:12</b> And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.<br/>
						<b>1:13</b> And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb''s younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.<br/>
						<b>1:14</b> And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?<br/>
						<b>1:15</b> And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.<br/>
						<b>1:16</b> And the children of the Kenite, Moses'' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.<br/>
						<b>1:17</b> And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.<br/>
						<b>1:18</b> Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.<br/>
						<b>1:19</b> And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.<br/>
						<b>1:20</b> And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak.<br/>
						<b>1:21</b> And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.<br/>
						<b>1:22</b> And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the LORD was with them.<br/>
						<b>1:23</b> And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.<br/>
						<b>1:24</b> And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy.<br/>
						<b>1:25</b> And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.<br/>
						<b>1:26</b> And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof unto this day.<br/>
						<b>1:27</b> Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.<br/>
						<b>1:28</b> And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.<br/>
						<b>1:29</b> Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.<br/>
						<b>1:30</b> Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries.<br/>
						<b>1:31</b> Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:<br/>
						<b>1:32</b> But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.<br/>
						<b>1:33</b> Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them.<br/>
						<b>1:34</b> And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:<br/>
						<b>1:35</b> But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.<br/>

						<b>1:1</b> Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.<br/>
						<b>1:2</b> And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.<br/>
						<b>1:3</b> And Elimelech Naomi''s husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.<br/>
						<b>1:4</b> And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.<br/>
						<b>1:5</b> And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.<br/>
						<b>1:6</b> Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the Lord had visited his people in giving them bread.<br/>
						<b>1:7</b> Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.<br/>
						<b>1:8</b> And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother''s house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.<br/>
						<b>1:9</b> The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.<br/>
						<b>1:10</b> And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.<br/>
						<b>1:11</b> And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?<br/>
						<b>1:12</b> Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;<br/>
						<b>1:13</b> Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.<br/>
						<b>1:14</b> And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.<br/>
						<b>1:15</b> And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.<br/>
						<b>1:16</b> And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:<br/>
						<b>1:17</b> Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.<br/>
						<b>1:18</b> When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.<br/>
						<b>1:19</b> So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?<br/>
						<b>1:20</b> And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.<br/>
						<b>1:21</b> I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?<br/>
						<b>1:22</b> So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.<br/>

						<b>1:1</b> Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:<br/>
						<b>1:2</b> And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.<br/>
						<b>1:3</b> And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.<br/>
						<b>1:4</b> And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:<br/>
						<b>1:5</b> But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.<br/>
						<b>1:6</b> And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.<br/>
						<b>1:7</b> And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.<br/>
						<b>1:8</b> Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?<br/>
						<b>1:9</b> So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.<br/>
						<b>1:10</b> And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.<br/>
						<b>1:11</b> And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.<br/>
						<b>1:12</b> And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth.<br/>
						<b>1:13</b> Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.<br/>
						<b>1:14</b> And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.<br/>
						<b>1:15</b> And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.<br/>
						<b>1:16</b> Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.<br/>
						<b>1:17</b> Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.<br/>
						<b>1:18</b> And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.<br/>
						<b>1:19</b> And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.<br/>
						<b>1:20</b> Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.<br/>
						<b>1:21</b> And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.<br/>
						<b>1:22</b> But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.<br/>
						<b>1:23</b> And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.<br/>
						<b>1:24</b> And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.<br/>
						<b>1:25</b> And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.<br/>
						<b>1:26</b> And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.<br/>
						<b>1:27</b> For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:<br/>

						<b>1:1</b> Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;<br/>
						<b>1:2</b> It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.<br/>
						<b>1:3</b> And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.<br/>
						<b>1:4</b> And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.<br/>
						<b>1:5</b> And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?<br/>
						<b>1:6</b> And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.<br/>
						<b>1:7</b> And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.<br/>
						<b>1:8</b> And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.<br/>
						<b>1:9</b> He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.<br/>
						<b>1:10</b> So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.<br/>
						<b>1:11</b> Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:<br/>
						<b>1:12</b> And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.<br/>
						<b>1:13</b> And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.<br/>
						<b>1:14</b> And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD''S anointed?<br/>
						<b>1:15</b> And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.<br/>
						<b>1:16</b> And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD''S anointed.<br/>
						<b>1:17</b> And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:<br/>
						<b>1:18</b> (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)<br/>
						<b>1:19</b> The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!<br/>
						<b>1:20</b> Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.<br/>
						<b>1:21</b> Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.<br/>
						<b>1:22</b> From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.<br/>
						<b>1:23</b> Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.<br/>
						<b>1:24</b> Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.<br/>
						<b>1:25</b> How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.<br/>
						<b>1:26</b> I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.<br/>

						<b>1:3</b> So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.<br/>
						<b>1:4</b> And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.<br/>
						<b>1:5</b> Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.<br/>
						<b>1:6</b> And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bare him after Absalom.<br/>

						<b>1:41</b> And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?<br/>
						<b>1:42</b> And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.<br/>
						<b>1:43</b> And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.<br/>
						<b>1:44</b> And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king''s mule:<br/>

						<b>1:46</b> And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.<br/>
						<b>1:47</b> And moreover the king''s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.<br/>
						<b>1:48</b> And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.<br/>
						<b>1:49</b> And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.<br/>
						<b>1:50</b> And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.<br/>
						<b>1:51</b> And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword.<br/>
						<b>1:52</b> And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.<br/>

						<b>1:1</b> Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab,<br/>
						<b>1:2</b> And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease,<br/>
						<b>1:3</b> But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron,<br/>
						<b>1:4</b> Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed,<br/>
						<b>1:5</b> And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back,<br/>
						<b>1:6</b> And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die,<br/>
						<b>1:7</b> And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up to meet you, and told you these words,<br/>
						<b>1:8</b> And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite,<br/>
						<b>1:9</b> Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down,<br/>
						<b>1:10</b> And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty,<br/>
						<b>1:11</b> Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly,<br/>
						<b>1:12</b> And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty,<br/>
						<b>1:13</b> And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight,<br/>
						<b>1:14</b> Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight,<br/>
						<b>1:15</b> And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king,<br/>
						<b>1:16</b> And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die,<br/>
						<b>1:17</b> So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son,<br/>
						<b>1:18</b> Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel,<br/>

						<b>1:2</b> That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,<br/>
						<b>1:3</b> In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:<br/>
						<b>1:4</b> When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days.<br/>
						<b>1:5</b> And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king''s palace;<br/>
						<b>1:6</b> Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.<br/>
						<b>1:7</b> And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king.<br/>
						<b>1:8</b> And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man''s pleasure.<br/>
						<b>1:9</b> Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.<br/>
						<b>1:10</b> On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,<br/>
						<b>1:11</b> To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on.<br/>

						<b>1:14</b> And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king''s face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;)<br/>
						<b>1:15</b> What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?<br/>

						<b>1:17</b> For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.<br/>
						<b>1:18</b> Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king''s princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.<br/>
						<b>1:19</b> If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.<br/>
						<b>1:20</b> And when the king''s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.<br/>
						<b>1:21</b> And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:<br/>
						<b>1:22</b> For he sent letters into all the king''s provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people.<br/>

						<b>1:2</b> And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.<br/>
						<b>1:3</b> His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.<br/>
						<b>1:4</b> And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.<br/>
						<b>1:5</b> And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.<br/>
						<b>1:6</b> Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.<br/>
						<b>1:7</b> And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.<br/>
						<b>1:8</b> And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?<br/>
						<b>1:9</b> Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?<br/>
						<b>1:10</b> Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.<br/>
						<b>1:11</b> But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.<br/>
						<b>1:12</b> And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.<br/>
						<b>1:13</b> And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother''s house:<br/>
						<b>1:14</b> And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:<br/>
						<b>1:15</b> And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.<br/>
						<b>1:16</b> While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.<br/>
						<b>1:17</b> While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.<br/>
						<b>1:18</b> While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother''s house:<br/>
						<b>1:19</b> And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.<br/>
						<b>1:20</b> Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,<br/>
						<b>1:21</b> And said, Naked came I out of my mother''s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.<br/>

						<b>1:1</b> The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;<br/>
						<b>1:2</b> To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;<br/>
						<b>1:3</b> To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;<br/>
						<b>1:4</b> To give subtlety to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.<br/>
						<b>1:5</b> A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:<br/>
						<b>1:6</b> To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.<br/>
						<b>1:7</b> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.<br/>
						<b>1:8</b> My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:<br/>
						<b>1:9</b> For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.<br/>
						<b>1:10</b> My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.<br/>
						<b>1:11</b> If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:<br/>
						<b>1:12</b> Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:<br/>
						<b>1:13</b> We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:<br/>
						<b>1:14</b> Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:<br/>
						<b>1:15</b> My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:<br/>
						<b>1:16</b> For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.<br/>
						<b>1:17</b> Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.<br/>
						<b>1:18</b> And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives.<br/>
						<b>1:19</b> So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.<br/>
						<b>1:20</b> Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:<br/>
						<b>1:21</b> She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,<br/>
						<b>1:22</b> How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?<br/>
						<b>1:23</b> Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.<br/>
						<b>1:24</b> Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;<br/>
						<b>1:25</b> But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:<br/>
						<b>1:26</b> I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;<br/>
						<b>1:27</b> When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.<br/>
						<b>1:28</b> Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:<br/>
						<b>1:29</b> For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:<br/>
						<b>1:30</b> They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.<br/>
						<b>1:31</b> Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.<br/>
						<b>1:32</b> For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.<br/>
						<b>1:33</b> But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.<br/>

						<b>1:2</b> Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.<br/>
						<b>1:3</b> The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master''s crib: but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.<br/>
						<b>1:4</b> Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.<br/>
						<b>1:5</b> Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.<br/>
						<b>1:6</b> From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.<br/>
						<b>1:7</b> Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.<br/>
						<b>1:8</b> And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.<br/>
						<b>1:9</b> Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.<br/>
						<b>1:10</b> Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.<br/>
						<b>1:11</b> To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.<br/>
						<b>1:12</b> When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?<br/>
						<b>1:13</b> Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.<br/>
						<b>1:14</b> Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.<br/>
						<b>1:15</b> And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.<br/>
						<b>1:16</b> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;<br/>
						<b>1:17</b> Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.<br/>

 						<b>1:16</b> And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.<br/>
 						<b>1:17</b> Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them.<br/>
 						<b>1:18</b> For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.<br/>

						<b>1:3</b> Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.<br/>
						<b>1:4</b> The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.<br/>
						<b>1:5</b> Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.<br/>
						<b>1:6</b> And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.<br/>
						<b>1:7</b> Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her, and did mock at her sabbaths.<br/>
						<b>1:8</b> Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.<br/>
						<b>1:9</b> Her filthiness is in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. O LORD, behold my affliction: for the enemy hath magnified himself.<br/>
 						<b>1:10</b> The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation.<br/>
 						<b>1:11</b> All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O LORD, and consider; for I am become vile.<br/>
 						<b>1:12</b> Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the LORD hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.<br/>
 						<b>1:13</b> From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made me desolate and faint all the day.<br/>
 						<b>1:14</b> The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, and come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall, the Lord hath delivered me into their hands, from whom I am not able to rise up.<br/>
 						<b>1:15</b> The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a winepress.<br/>
 						<b>1:16</b> For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.<br/>
 						<b>1:17</b> Zion spreadeth forth her hands, and there is none to comfort her: the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob, that his adversaries should be round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.<br/>
 						<b>1:18</b> The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.<br/>
 						<b>1:19</b> I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought their meat to relieve their souls.<br/>
 						<b>1:20</b> Behold, O LORD; for I am in distress: my bowels are troubled; mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as death.<br/>
						<b>1:21</b> They have heard that I sigh: there is none to comfort me: all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done it: thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called, and they shall be like unto me.<br/>

						<b>1:3</b> The word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him.<br/>
						<b>1:4</b> And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.<br/>

						<b>1:8</b> And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.<br/>
						<b>1:9</b> Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.<br/>

						<b>1:12</b> And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.<br/>
						<b>1:13</b> As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.<br/>

						<b>1:17</b> When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went.<br/>
						<b>1:18</b> As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.<br/>
						<b>1:19</b> And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.<br/>
						<b>1:20</b> Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.<br/>
						<b>1:21</b> When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.<br/>
						<b>1:22</b> And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads abovebr//
						<b>1:23</b> And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.</br/>
						<b>1:24</b> And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.</br/>
						<b>1:25</b> And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.</br/>
						<b>1:26</b> And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.</br/>

						<b>1:1</b> In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.<br/>
						<b>1:2</b> And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.<br/>
						<b>1:3</b> And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king''s seed, and of the princes;<br/>
						<b>1:4</b> Children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king''s palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.<br/>
						<b>1:5</b> And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king''s meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.<br/>
						<b>1:6</b> Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:<br/>
						<b>1:7</b> Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.<br/>
						<b>1:8</b> But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king''s meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.<br/>
						<b>1:9</b> Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.<br/>
						<b>1:10</b> And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king.<br/>
						<b>1:11</b> Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,<br/>
						<b>1:12</b> Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.<br/>
						<b>1:13</b> Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king''s meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.<br/>
						<b>1:14</b> So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.<br/>
						<b>1:15</b> And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king''s meat.<br/>
						<b>1:16</b> Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.<br/>
						<b>1:17</b>> As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.<br/>
						<b>1:18</b> Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.<br/>
						<b>1:19</b> And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.<br/>
						<b>1:20</b> And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.<br/>
						<b>1:21</b> And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.<br/>

					<h1>Hosea</h1>
					<p>
						<b>1:1</b> The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.<br/>
						<b>1:2</b> The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great whoredom, departing from the LORD.<br/>
						<b>1:3</b> So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son.<br/>
						<b>1:4</b> And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.<br/>
						<b>1:5</b> And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.<br/>
						<b>1:6</b> And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said unto him, Call her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away.<br/>
						<b>1:7</b> But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.<br/>
						<b>1:8</b> Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.<br/>
						<b>1:9</b> Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for ye are not my people, and I will not be your God.<br/>
						<b>1:10</b>	Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God.<br/>
						<b>1:11</b>	Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel.<br/>

					<h1>Joel</h1>
					<p>
						<b>1:1</b> The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.<br/> 
						<b>1:2</b> Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?<br/> 
						<b>1:3</b> Tell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children another generation.<br/> 
						<b>1:4</b> That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten.<br/> 
						<b>1:5</b> Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine, for it is cut off from your mouth.<br/> 
						<b>1:6</b> For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion.<br/> 
						<b>1:7</b> He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white.<br/> 
						<b>1:8</b> Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.<br/> 
						<b>1:9</b> The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD''S ministers, mourn.<br/> 
						<b>1:10</b> The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.<br/> 
						<b>1:11</b> Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished.<br/> 
						<b>1:12</b> The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men.<br/> 
						<b>1:13</b> Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God.<br/> 
						<b>1:14</b> Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the LORD your God, and cry unto the LORD.<br/> 
						<b>1:15</b> Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD is at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.<br/> 
						<b>1:16</b> Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness from the house of our God?<br/> 
						<b>1:17</b> The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered.<br/> 
						<b>1:18</b> How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.<br/> 
						<b>1:19</b> O LORD, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field.<br/> 
						<b>1:20</b> The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.<br/>

						<b>1:1</b> The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.<br/>
						<b>1:2</b> And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.<br/>
						<b>1:3</b> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:<br/>
						<b>1:4</b> But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall devour the palaces of Benhadad.<br/>
						<b>1:5</b> I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir, saith the LORD.<br/>
						<b>1:6</b> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they carried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver them up to Edom:<br/>
						<b>1:7</b> But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour the palaces thereof:<br/>
						<b>1:8</b> And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon, and I will turn mine hand against Ekron: and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord GOD.<br/>
						<b>1:9</b> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant:<br/>
						<b>1:10</b> But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus, which shall devour the palaces thereof.<br/>
						<b>1:11</b> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever:<br/>
						<b>1:12</b> But I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.<br/>
						<b>1:13</b> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they might enlarge their border:<br/>
						<b>1:14</b> But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind:<br/>
						<b>1:15</b> And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, saith the LORD.<br/>

					<p>
						<b>1:1</b> The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning Edom; We have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.<br/>
						<b>1:2</b> Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art greatly despised.<br/>
						<b>1:3</b> The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?<br/>
						<b>1:4</b> Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the LORD.<br/>
						<b>1:5</b> If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some grapes?<br/>
						<b>1:6</b> How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden things sought up!<br/>
						<b>1:7</b> All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; they that eat thy bread have laid a wound under thee: there is none understanding in him.<br/>
						<b>1:8</b> Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, even destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?<br/>
						<b>1:9</b> And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.<br/>
						<b>1:10</b> For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.<br/>
						<b>1:11</b> In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them.<br/>
						<b>1:12</b> But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress.<br/>
						<b>1:13</b> Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity;<br/>
						<b>1:14</b> Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress.<br/>
						<b>1:15</b> For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head.<br/>
						<b>1:16</b> For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.<br/>
						<b>1:17</b> But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.<br/>
						<b>1:18</b> And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken it.<br/>
						<b>1:19</b> And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and they of the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin shall possess Gilead.<br/>
						<b>1:20</b> And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall possess that of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath; and the captivity of Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the south.<br/>
						<b>1:21</b> And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD''S.<br/>
